# Exercise: Return persons by last name, return relief efforts by name

## What you will learn

- Create 2 views containing a `map()` function to query the database.
- Query the views using Futon.

## Instructions

- Remember the `createView()` helper function?  Create some code to call your `createView()` helper function to add 2 design documents to the database.  Each design document should contain a single view.  The views _should not_ `emit` the document.  
 <table>
    <tr>
      <th>design doc `_id` property value</th>
      <th>view name</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`__design/lastname`</td>
      <td>lastname</td>
      <td>List and sort persons by last name.  Hint: A person's last name is not guaranteed to be unique.  How can you ensure each key value returned by this view is unique?</td>
    </tr>  
    <tr>
      <td>`_design/reliefefforts`</td>
      <td>reliefefforts</td>
      <td>List and sort relief efforts by relief effort name.</td>
    </tr>  
  </table>

- Use Futon to run the queries.
