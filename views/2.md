# Exercise: Creating Relief Tracker Views

This exercise is a continuation of our relief tracker application.  You will create views that support specific application functionality.  

## What you will learn

- Create view containing `map()` functions to query the database.
- Query the views using Futon.

## Instructions

- Create the following views. Remember the `createView()` helper function?  Create some code to call your `createView()` helper function to add the views to the database.  The views _should not_ `emit` the document.  
 <table>
    <tr>
      <th>design doc `_id` property value</th>
      <th>view name</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`__design/lastNameView`</td>
      <td>lastNameView</td>
      <td>List and sort persons by last name.  Hint: Ensure each key value returned by this view is unique.</td>
    </tr>  
    <tr>
      <td>`_design/reliefEfforts`</td>
      <td>reliefEfforts</td>
      <td>List and sort relief efforts by relief effort name.</td>
    </tr>  
  </table>

- Using Futon, select each view to check the results.
