# Exercise: Retrieving Lists of Persons and Relief Efforts

## What you will learn

- Learn how to sort data.
- Learn how to support pagination.

## Instructions

This exercise will will leverage the 3 views you just created to provide sorted lists of persons and relief efforts.
- You'll need some data to play with.  Seed the database with additional people.  Be sure to add multiple people with the name last name such as Tom Jones, Steve Jones, Davey Jones, Chipper Jones, etc.  
-  Add relief efforts using similar relief effort names.
- Create a public function named `listPersons()` which enables the ability to paginate though a list of persons by:
  - last name
  - email address
- Create a public function named `listReliefEfforts()` which enables the ability to paginate though a list of relief efforts by the relief effort name.  
- Each function should contain the following parameters:
  - `sortBy` (Required) indicates how the list should be sorted.  
  - `startKey` (Required) indicates the starting place for the documents returned. A value of `""` indicates that you would like to return documenting start at the beginning of the view results.
  - `limit` (Required) supports pagination by limiting the number of documents returned.  Example:  A value of `5` returns 5 documents per request.

  Examples:

  ```
  function listPersons(sortBy, startKey, limit, callback) {  ...  }
  function listReliefEfforts(sortBy, startKey, limit, callback) {  ... }
  ```

  > Hint:  To successfully paginate, you must be able to uniquely identify each document returned.  

## Try it out

- Create some code to test your new functions. Perform the following queries.  Output your results via `console.log`:

0. `console.log` the first 3 person documents sorted by last name.
0. `console.log` the first 4th, 5th, and 6th person documents sorted by last name.
0. `console.log` the first 5 person documents sorted by email address.
