# Intro to curl

[curl](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html) is a tool to transfer data from or to a server using a wide variety of protocols, such as HTTP/HTTPS.  We'll use curl to talk to CouchDB by issuing HTTP calls to do things like creating a database, editing and saving JSON documents, and define and run queries.

curl is a command line interface (CLI) which means you have to use a command-line tool such as Terminal, iTerm, bash, etc.  Windows peeps can use the command prompt. CLI's work at a lower level than Windows and you will have more control over the machine. But, it's less user-friendly.
