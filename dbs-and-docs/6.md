# Exercise: Deleting a document

- A new database named `test` has been created and two drivers have been added for you.
- Delete Taylor Swift's record.  
- Once you've deleted her record, attempt to retrieve her deleted record back from the database.

  > You should receive an _error message_ stating that the document is missing.  The callback to test for the appropriate error message has been provided.  Similarly to previous exercises, the 3rd callback will utilize a function named `testcallback` to check your work.
