# Exercise: Designing Searchable Document IDs

In this exercise, you will gain experience designing simple documents with searchable yet unique document IDs.  A new database named `movie` has been created. The documents have been started but are not yet complete.  One type of document tracks actors while the other tracks movies that contain the actor.  You will need to review all the steps in this exercise and determine the best `_id` values to support the requirements.

- Review the data within your "actor" documents, consider the following and adjust the data within the document.
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Actor Document Property</th>
      <th>Hints/Notes</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`_id`</td>
      <td>Distinguish "actor" documents from other types of documents in the database. Consider using a prefix value for document's `_id` property. </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
- Review the data within your "movie" documents, consider the following and adjust the data within the document.:
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Movie Document Property</th>
      <th>Hints/Notes</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`_id`</td>
      <td>Distinguish "movie" documents from other types of documents in the database. Consider using a prefix value for document's `_id` property. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>actorID</td>
      <td>Used to "link" a movie with the actor.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

- We've included the call to `bulkDocs()` to add the actor and movie documents with a single call.  
- Create three queries to fulfill the following requirements.  Adjust the `_id` values in your docs to facilitate querying.  
  1. List all the actors sorted by first name then last name
  2. List all movies with Emma Watson
  3. list all movies with John Candy released in 1986 and 1987
