## Installing curl

Use the [curl Download Wizard](https://curl.haxx.se/dlwiz/?type=bin) to help you select the correct zip file to download for your operating system.  The zip file should contain an executable file named **curl.exe**.  If you unzip the file and don't see the .exe file, you've downloaded the wrong file.

> Windows users will need to be sure and select the correct Operating system (Win32 or Win64).

### Windows users

- Extract the contents of the zip file. If you have downloaded the correct version you should find **curl.exe**.
- Place **curl.exe** in a folder where you keep your software (e.g. D:\software\curl\curl.exe)
- To run curl from the command line, you must ensure the .exe is in your system path.

  - Right click **My Computer**
  - Select **Properties**
  - Click **Advanced system settings** link
  - On the **Advanced** tab, select the **Environment Variables** button.
  - Under System variable select 'Path' and edit.
  - Add a semicolon followed by the path to where you placed your **curl.exe** file. (e.g.: D:\software\curl)
