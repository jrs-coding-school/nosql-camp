# Exercise: Create a person

In this exercise we will create an API endpoint/route named `/persons` that supports adding a single person into the database via the HTTP `POST` verb. When receiving a `POST` or `PUT` request, the request body is important,  In our case the request body should contains a JSON document representing the person to add:

```
{
     "firstName": "Mary",
     "lastName": "Gonzalez",
     "phone": "404 303-1234",
     "email": "mgo1234@yahoo.com"
}
```

Getting at the request body data is a little more involved than accessing data in the request header, route, or query parameter. Luckily, the [Express middleware ecosystem](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware.html) contains middleware that you can leverage to help parse the request body.  The npm `body-parser` module can be used to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your route handlers.  See [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser).

Once you have wired up the body parser, your endpoint logic should make a call to the DAL's `createPerson()` function, passing the data within the request body as a parameter to the function.   

Manually test your new endpoint and DAL function by adding 5 records to the database using POSTMan.  To accurately test the DAL function, attempt to add data with missing required values..
