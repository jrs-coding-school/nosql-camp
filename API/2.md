# Exercise: Create a "good" route and a "bad" route

The goal of this exercise is to get you familiar with writing an error handler with Express. In this exercise we will create a "bad" route that causes an error.  We will write some middleware to handle the error and send a helpful `node-http-error` message back to the client.  

- Utilize the ExpressJS `use` function to create the error handler middleware.  See [Middleware](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html) and [Error Handling](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/error-handling.html).  
- Within your **app.js** file, create a `\bad` route that handles an http `GET` request.  Any call to this route should cause a 'bad request' error.  Use the `node-http-error` module to represent the http error. See [node-http-error](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-http-error) and [List of HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).

  > Hint: use `next` within your "bad" route request handler facilitate the passing a 'bad client request' error to your error handler middleware.

- Test your home route and the new "bad" route using POSTman.
