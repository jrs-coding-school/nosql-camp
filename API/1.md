# Exercise: Create an Express HTTP Web Server

[Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.  You can use Express to create an Application Programming Interface (API).  

In this exercise you will:

- Create an http server using express
- Respond to a `GET` request to the home route:  `localhost:4000/`

Create a subfolder and file to hold our API code:

- Within the **relief-student** project folder, open the **API** folder.
- Within your new **API** folder, open **app.js**.  This file will contain your web server / API code.  
- Write code to require the `http` and `express` modules.
- Write code to create an http server and listen on a specific port. You can add variables (such as `PORT`) to the user environment when running your program at runtime:

  ```
  $ cd relief-student
  $ PORT=4000 node API/app.js
  ```
- Within your program, use `process.env` to access the contents of the user environment. See [process.env](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_env).

- For starters, create a piece of middleware to respond to a `GET` request to the 'home' route:

  ```
  app.get('/', function (req, res) {
    res.send('Hello World!');
  });
  ```

- Test your api 'home route' using your browser and POSTman.
