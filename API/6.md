# Exercise: Create a relief effort

In this exercise we will create an API endpoint/route named `/reliefefforts` that supports adding a single relief effort into the database via HTTP `POST`. When receiving a `POST` or `PUT` request, the request body is important,  In our case the request body should contains a JSON document representing the relief effort to add:

```
{
  "phase": "planning",
  "name": "Haiti Hurricane Matthew 2016",
  "organizationID": "Christ Church",
  "desc": "Provide hurricane relief to the village of Gros Mangle on the island of La Gonave, Haiti.  Island of La Gonave, Haiti. Home base is located in the main town of Anse - à - Galets at the St.François d’ Assise church and school.The bulk of the mission work will take place at St.Esprit church and school in the remote village of Gros Mangle, Haiti.",
  "start": "2016-12-01",
  "end": "2016-12-08",
  "team": [
    {
      "name": "Steve Harvey",
      "role": "Team Leader",
      "personID": "person_steveharvey1111@gmail.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "Libby Satterfield",
      "role": "Team member",
      "personID": "person_lsat1972@gmail.com"
    },
    {
      "name": "Jimmy Martin",
      "role": "Team member",
      "personID": "person_JimmyMartinJr@gmail.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

Once you have wired up the body parser, your endpoint logic should make a call to the DAL's `createReliefEffort()` function, passing the data within the request body as a parameter to the function.   

Manually test your new endpoint and DAL function by adding 5 records to the database using POSTMan.  To accurately test the DAL function, attempt to add data with missing required values..
