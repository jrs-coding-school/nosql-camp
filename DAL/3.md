# Exercise: Deleting a Person and Relief Effort

## What you will learn

- Create a helper function to remove any document from the database

## Instructions

This exercise is similar to the previous exercises, but with a useful twist.  Create a private, helper function named `deleteDoc()` within the **/DAL/noSQL.js** javascript file.  The function is responsible for deleting any type of document from the database. The function will take a data argument and a callback function.

```
function deleteDoc(data, callback) {...your code here...}
```

The `data` argument is used to pass in the document you wish to delete.   You can pass in a person or a relief effort.

- Open the **/DAL/noSQL.js** javascript file.
- Within the file, add the beginnings of the `deleteDoc()` helper function to the file.
- _Do not_ add the function as a new property to the `dal` object.  Since this is a private function, we won't export it to the outside world.

### Validate

Deleting a document requires that your data contains at least an `_id` and `_rev` property.  If any validations fail, your function should return a `new Error` via the callback.

Example:

```
if (data.hasOwnProperty('_id') !== true) {
     return callback(new Error('400Missing _id property from data'));
}
```

### Deleting the documents from the database

- Within your `deleteDoc()` helper function, utilize the [PouchDB api](https://pouchdb.com/api.html) to remove the document from the database and return either the error or the response from the database using the callback parameter.
- Call the helper function from two public functions named `deletePerson()` and `deleteReliefEffort()`.  Here is an example:

```
function deletePerson(data, callback) {
    deleteDoc(data, callback);
}
```
- Since `deletePerson()` and `deleteReliefEffort()` are public facing you will need to expose them to the outside world.

### Try it out

Now it's time to try out your new functions by attempting to add then remove persons and relief efforts from the database.  

- Write and run some code to add a couple of relief efforts and persons to the database.  `console.log` the error or the response.
- Write and run some code to delete the same relief efforts and persons from the database.  `console.log` the error or the response.

## Test
- Test your code by running the following tests.  Fix any issues and rerun the tests until everything passes.  

   ```
   $ cd relief-student
   $ NODE_ENV=production node test deleteReliefEffort
   $ NODE_ENV=production node test deletePerson
   ```
