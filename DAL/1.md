# Exercise: Adding Persons

This exercise is the beginning step in the creation of a data access layer or DAL.  We will create a function to add a person into the **relief-tracker** database within CouchDB on your local machine.  

## Prerequisites

Before you can attempt this exercise you must have successfully completed the [README](https://github.com/jrs-innovation-center/relief-student) instructions for the **Relief Tracker Starter Pack**.  This README provides guidance for installing CouchDB, curl, and the **relief-student** project and dependencies on your local machine.

## Instructions

> Where do I put my code? Add your code into your local clone of the **relief-student** repo. Your code should reside within the repo's **/DAL/noSQL.js** javascript file.

- On your local machine, open your code editor, such as Atom.
- Open the **relief-student** folder/project within your code editor.
- Open the **/DAL/noSQL.js** javascript file and inspect the code that has been started for you.

- Create a function named `createPerson()` within the **/DAL/noSQL.js** javascript file.  

   The function is responsible for adding a new person document into the **relief-student** database on your local machine. The function will take a data argument and a callback function.

   ```
   function createPerson(data, callback) {...your code here...}
   ```

   The `data` argument is used to pass a person in the form of a JSON document:

   ```
   {
      type: "person",
      firstName: "Steve",
      lastName: "Ananias",
      phone: "843 555-1515",
      email: "stevean@duke.edu"
   }
   ```

   Passing in a callback function provides `createPerson()` a mechanism to 'call you back' after the database has added the person document into the database (or when an error occurs).

- Add the function as a new property to the `dal` object.  Notice that `dal` is exported and thereby provides an interface to any other code that requires this module.

### Validate

Your code should validate the incoming document for bad or missing data before adding the data into the **relief-student** database. If a property fails validation, return a new `Error()` that includes an error message prefixed with a `400` [HTTP Error code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).

Example:

```
if (data.hasOwnProperty('lastName') !== true) {
      return callback(new Error('400Missing lastName property within data'));
}
```

- Within your `createPerson()` function, validate the following attributes:
   - `_id` attribute is not permitted.
   - `_rev` attribute is not permitted.
   - `lastName`, `firstName`, `email` attributes are required.



### Providing default values

- Provide the following attribute default values before adding the document to the database:
   - `_id` attribute value should default with a prefix of `"person_"` and the `email` address.
   - `active` attribute value should default to `true`.  
   - `type` attribute value should default to `"person"`.

   Example:

   ```
   {
     "_id": "person_gary.johnson1971@gmail.com",
     "type": "person",
     "firstName": "Gary",
     "lastName": "Johnson",
     "phone": "843 555-9876",
     "email": "gary.johnson1971@gmail.com",
     "active": true
   }
   ```

### Add the document to the database

- Within your function, utilize the [PouchDB api](https://pouchdb.com/api.html) to add the person to the database.

- After adding the document into the database, your code should return either the error or the response from the database using the callback parameter.

### Try it out

Now it's time to try out your new function by attempting to add documents to the database.  

- Create a separate javascript file named **createpersontest.js**.  This file is not really a part of your official application, it is just a convienient way to try out your new function.
- Within this file, create a call your new function, passing the data into the call.  `console.log` the error or the response.
- Save and run the file:

   ```
   $ NODE_ENV=production node createpersontest
   ```

- Repeat this process until you have 5 new persons in the database.

## Test

- Test your code by running the following command.  Correct any issues the test uncovers.
   ```
   $ NODE_ENV=production node test createPerson
   ```
