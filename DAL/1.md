# Exercise: Adding a `createPerson()` function to the DAL

## Prerequisites

Before you can attempt this exercise you must have successfully completed the [README](https://github.com/jrs-innovation-center/relief-student) instructions for the **Relief Tracker Starter Pack**.  This README provides guidance for installing CouchDB, curl, and the **relief-student** repository on your local machine.

## Instructions

> Add your code into your local clone of the **relief-student** repo. Your code should reside within the repo's **/DAL/noSQL.js** javascript file. 

In this exercise, you will create a function named `createPerson()` that is responsible for adding a new person document into the **relief-tracker** database on your local machine. The function will take a data argument and a callback function.

```
function createPerson(data, callback) {...your code here...}
```

The `data` argument is used to pass a person in the form of a JSON document. Passing in a callback function provides the `createPerson()` function a mechanism to 'call you back' after the database has added the person document into the database (or when an error occurs).

Before your function adds the data into the **relief-tracker** database, you must validate the incoming document for bad or missing data. If any of the following validations fail, your function should return a `new Error` via the callback. Here is an example of validating that the person data passed into the function includes a `lastName` property. If not, an error is returned.

```
if (data.hasOwnProperty('lastName') !== true) {
      return callback(new Error('Missing lastName property within data'));
    }
```

Your function is responsible validating the following attributes:

- `_id` attribute is not permitted.
- `_rev` attribute is not permitted.
- `lastName`, `firstName`, `email` are required.

Your function is responsible for providing the following attribute values:

- `_id` attribute value should be prefixed with `person_` followed by the person's email address.
- `active` attribute value should default to `true`.

Example data to be `put()` into the database:

```
{
   "_id": "person_gary.johnson1971@gmail.com",
   "type": "person",
   "firstName": "Gary",
   "lastName": "Johnson",
   "phone": "843 555-9876",
   "email": "gary.johnson1971@gmail.com",
   "active": true
}
```

After making the call to `put()` the document into the database, your code should call the callback returning either the error or the response from the database.
