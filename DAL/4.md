# Exercise: Updating a Person and Relief Effort

## What you will learn

- Create a helper function to update any document in the database

## Instructions

This exercise is similar to the previous delete exercise.  Create a private, helper function named `updateDoc()` within the **/DAL/noSQL.js** javascript file.  The function is responsible for updating any type of document from the database. The function will take a data argument and a callback function.  Updating a document requires that your data contains at least an `_id` and `_rev` property.  If any validations fail, your function should return a `new Error` via the callback.  Within **/DAL/noSQL.js**, call `updateDoc()` from two public functions named `updatePerson()` and `updateReliefEffort()`.

## Try it out

- Try out your new functions by attempting to update existing persons and relief efforts in the database.  `console.log` the error or the response.

## Test
- Test your code by running the following tests.  Fix any issues and rerun the tests until everything passes.  

   ```
   $ cd relief-student
   $ NODE_ENV=production node test updateReliefEffort
   $ NODE_ENV=production node test updatePerson
   ```
