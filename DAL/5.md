# Exercise: Retrieving Persons and Relief Efforts

## What you will learn

- Create a helper function to get any document in the database

## Instructions

This exercise is similar to the last exercises.  Create a private, helper function named `getDocByID()` within the **/DAL/noSQL.js** javascript file.  The function is responsible for retrieving any type of document from the database using an `id ` parameter.
```
function getDocByID(id, callback) { ... your code here ... }
```

## Validate

Before you retrieve the document from the database, make sure you have a valid `id` parameter.

## Try it out

- Try out your new functions by attempting to retrieve existing persons and relief efforts from the database.
