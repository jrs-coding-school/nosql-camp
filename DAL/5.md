# Exercise: Retrieving a Person and Relief Effort

## What you will learn

- Create a helper function to get any document in the database

## Instructions

-Create a private, helper function named `getDocByID()` within the **/DAL/noSQL.js** javascript file.  The function is responsible for retrieving any type of document from the database using an `id ` parameter.
```
function getDocByID(id, callback) { ... your code here ... }
```

- After retrieving the document from the database, your helper function should call the callback and return either the error or the response from the database.
- Within **/DAL/noSQL.js**, call `getDocByID()` from two public functions named `getPerson()` and `getReliefEffort()`.


## Validate

Before you retrieve the document from the database, make sure you have a valid `id` parameter.

## Try it out

- Create some code to call your public functions to retrieve existing persons and relief efforts from the database.  `console.log` the data.
