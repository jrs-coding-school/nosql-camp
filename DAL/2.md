# Exercise: Adding a `createReliefEffort()` function to the DAL

## Instructions

Create a function named `createReliefEffort()` within the **/DAL/noSQL.js** javascript file.  The function is responsible for adding a new relief document into the **relief-student** database on your local machine. The function will take a data argument and a callback function.

```
function createReliefEffort(data, callback) {...your code here...}
```

The `data` argument is used to pass a relief effort in the form of a JSON document.  Here's an example of a relief document that is ready to be added into the database:

```
{
    "_id": "relief_St_Phillips_Haiti_2015",
    "type": "relief",
    "phase": "completed",
    "name": "Haiti 2015",
    "organizationID": "St. Phillips",
    "desc": "Build school desks and blackboards at the St. Esprit (Holy Spirit) church and school in the remote village of Gros Mangle in the island of La Gonave, Haiti. Home base is located in the main town of Anse - à - Galets at the St.François d’ Assise church and school.",
    "start": "2015-09-25",
    "end": "2015-10-01",
    "team": [{
        "name": "Steve Ananias",
        "role": "Team Leader",
        "personID": "person_stevean@duke.edu"
    }, {
        "name": "Libby Satterfield",
        "role": "Team member",
        "personID": "person_lsat1972@gmail.com"
    }, {
        "name": "Judy Jones",
        "role": "Team member",
        "personID": "person_judy5555@aol.com"
    }]
};
```

### Validate before add

- Within your function, validate the following attributes for the incoming data:
   - `_id` attribute is not permitted.
   - `_rev` attribute is not permitted.
   - `phase`, `name`, `organizationID` are required.

- Within your function, provide the following attribute values to the data:
   - `_id` attribute value should default with a prefix of `"relief"` and the `organizationID` address and the organization's `name`.
   - `active` attribute value should default to `true`.
   - `type` attribute value should default to `"relief"`.

### Try it out

Now it's time to try out your new function by attempting to add documents to the database.  

- Create a separate javascript file named **createreliefeffortest.js**.
- Within this file, call your new  function, passing the data into the call.  Here's an example:

   ```
   const dalNoSQL = require('./DAL/noSQL.js');

   const createReliefEffortDataHugo = {
       "phase": "completed",
       "name": "Hurricane Hugo 1989",
       "organizationID": "Hurricane Helpers",
       "desc": "Purricane Hugo was a powerful Cape Verde-type hurricane that caused widespread damage and loss of life in the Leeward Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Southeast United States in 1989",
       "start": "1989-09-10",
       "end": "1989-09-25",
       "active": true
   };

   dalNoSQL.createReliefEffort(createReliefEffortDataHugo, function callback (err, response) {
         if (err) return console.log(err);
         if (response) return console.log(response);
   });
   ```

- Save and run the file:

   ```
   $ NODE_ENV=production node createreliefeffortest
   ```

- Repeat until you have 5 persons in the database.

## Test

- Test your code by running the following command.  Correct any issues.
   ```
   $ NODE_ENV=production node test createReliefEffort
   ```
